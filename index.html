            <p>Puerto Rico, an enchanting island in the Caribbean, is celebrated not only for its vibrant 
		culture but also for its stunning natural beauty and rich biodiversity. As a tropical paradise, 
		Puerto Rico boasts lush rainforests, pristine beaches, and mountain ranges that cradle its unique ecosystems.
		The island is home to the El Yunque National Forest, the only tropical rainforest in the United 
		States National Forest System, which spans over 28,000 acres and hosts a dazzling variety of plant 
		and animal life. This dense, verdant rainforest is adorned with countless waterfalls, hiking trails, 
		and flora and fauna found nowhere else on Earth.</p>

            <p>Puerto Rico's geographical location makes it a unique meeting point for diverse marine and 
		terrestrial species. Its coastline stretches over 270 miles, with beaches that are famous for 
		their soft sands and turquoise waters and are often ranked 
		among the world’s most beautiful beaches. Coral reefs and mangrove ecosystems abound along Puerto 
		Rico’s shores, creating essential habitats for tropical fish, crustaceans, and migratory birds. 
		Additionally, the island's offshore bioluminescent bays, such as the one in Vieques. 
		These bays are among the few places in the world where bioluminescence is so visible, making Puerto 
		Rico a unique destination for nature enthusiasts and scientists alike.</p>

            <p>Puerto Rico is a land of resilience—rich in culture, pride, and history. Yet, beneath the beauty lies a long 
		and painful legacy of systemic violence, exploitation, and forced displacement. From the first colonial invasions 
		to present-day environmental and economic struggles, Puerto Ricans have faced generation after generation of injustice—often 
		from foreign powers and corrupt leadership.</p>

            <p>This site invites you to explore that legacy through an interactive timeline that uncovers how colonialism, military 
		intervention, economic manipulation, and political neglect have shaped the lives of Puerto Ricans. You'll see how policies 
		led to the forced sterilization of women, the economic collapse of entire communities, and the stripping of rights 
		that continues to this day.</p>

            <p>This isn’t just a history lesson. It’s a mirror to the present. This project is not about blame—it’s about 
	awareness. About understanding what has been allowed to happen, and what continues. It is a call: to learn, 
	to see, and to act.</p>
