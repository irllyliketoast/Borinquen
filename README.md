# Borinquén: The Forgotten History of Puerto Rico

**Author**: Laura Estremera

**Capstone Project – Digital Arts**
University of North Carolina Wilmington

---

## Project Overview

**Borinquén** is an interactive, hand-coded educational website that explores the displacement of Puerto Rican communities through an immersive digital timeline. Combining web development, historical research, and stylized 3D animation, the project aims to shed light on centuries of colonial violence, forced migration, and socio-political neglect—while honoring Puerto Rico’s rich cultural and ecological identity.

The website is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with visual storytelling enhanced by **Blender-rendered animations** and planned data visualizations. It invites users to engage with Puerto Rico’s history through a multimedia timeline and a forthcoming ecological section centered on the endangered *coquí* frog.

---

## Website Structure

* **Homepage**: An animated landing page introducing the project’s mission, visual design, and user path to the timeline.
* **Interactive Timeline**: A scrollable, animated timeline featuring nine key eras of Puerto Rican history—each with hover effects, click-to-expand narratives, and embedded animations.
* **Planned Environmental Section** *(in development)*: A scroll-driven rainforest experience exploring the coquí’s ecological decline as a metaphor for cultural erasure and environmental injustice.

---

## Key Features

* **Interactive Timeline**
  Each timeline point contains hover interactions, animated video backgrounds, historical data, and accessible textual content.

* **Blender Animations**
  Nine stylized scenes created in Blender depict historical turning points, including:

  * Taíno resistance
  * U.S. invasion (1898)
  * Mass sterilizations
  * Hurricane María and neglect
  * 2020s gentrification and cultural resistance

* **Custom Cursor and Loader**
  A personalized UI experience with animated loaders and cursor design matching the project’s aesthetic.

* **Responsive Design**
  Website adapts to various screen sizes using a combination of CSS Flexbox/Grid and media queries.

* **Museum-Style Citations:** 'View Sources' buttons reveal expandable annotated bibliographies.

## Future Expansion: Ecological Scrollytelling

A second major section is underway—a vertical-scrolling rainforest that visualizes the decline of *coquí* populations. It will feature:

* **Parallax scrolling** to simulate rainforest depth
* **Audio transitions** from vibrant frog calls to eerie silence
* **Data visualizations** on species loss and urban expansion
* **Ghost frogs** and poetry fragments revealing cultural memory
* **Glitch animations** to represent urban sprawl and biodiversity collapse

## Purpose

This project does not seek to shame but to **educate**. It calls attention to the long arc of colonial oppression and modern displacement. It is a testimony to Puerto Rican resilience, a multimedia archive of resistance, and a platform for justice-oriented storytelling.
