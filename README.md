## About the Project

**Borinquén** is a hand-coded, interactive website that explores the historical and ongoing displacement of Puerto Ricans. Through an immersive timeline, custom animations, and layered storytelling, the project reveals the deep impact of colonialism, military intervention, economic exploitation, and political repression on Puerto Rican identity and culture.

This project was developed as a Digital Arts Capstone to foster awareness, challenge historical erasure, and encourage critical engagement with Puerto Rico’s ongoing struggles.
